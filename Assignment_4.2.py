Problem Statement: 4.2

Find the variance for the following set of data representing trees in California (heights in
feet):   3, 21, 98, 203, 17, 9
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
I Step : Add all numbers
3 + 21 + 98 + 203 + 17 + 9 = 351


II Step : Square your result from I step and and divide by the number of items (6).

351 × 351 = 123,201

123,201 / 6 = 20,533.5

Consider 'A' = 20,533.5

III Step : Now consider all the numbers from I Step, and square them seperately as below 
and Add those numbers together after squaring:

3 × 3 + 21 × 21 + 98 × 98 + 203 × 203 + 17 × 17 + 9 × 9

9 + 441 + 9604 + 41209 + 289 + 81 = 51,633

IV Step : Subtract the amount in 'A' (II Step) from the amount in III Step.

51,633 – 20,533.5 = 31,099.5

Consider 'B'= 31,099.5

V Step : Subtract 1 from the number of items in your data set*.

6 – 1 = 5

IV Step : Divide the number in IV Step by the number in V Step.

This gives the variance:
    
31,099.5/5 = 6,219.9


Variance = 6,219.9
